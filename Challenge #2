Write a program that reads dataModel.json and validates every entity in the json(life_event, experience)
if a field is incorrect it should throw an error

- all fields must have a type
- valid types are string|boolean|date|hasMany
- if a field is hasMany it should contain an entity property
- if field hasMany and has entity property it must be an entity in json

Program requirements:
- you will need to install node http://nodejs.org/
- use jshint to validate your code style # https://github.com/MethodExists/js-style-guide
 you can copy the .jshintrc to check your style, we use SublimeText + JSHint plugin
- Write some test in mocha to validate your solution 

Bonus points:
- Upload your solution to a repository in github
- Use check-types to verify values https://github.com/philbooth/check-types.js
